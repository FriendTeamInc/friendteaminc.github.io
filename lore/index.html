			<h1>Lore Page (Wowza) (no way!) (ikr)</h1>
			<p>This page will contain a bunch of info about us in our little universe in New Port, keep an eye out for when its ready!</p>
<!-- 
			<h1>The Setting</h1>
			<p>New Port, Riverton is a very large city on the east coast of the Countiguous Counties. Home to many businesses, big and small, it is a critical point of distribution for shipments coming in and out of the country. Because its waters are largely for commercial use only, housing is relatively cheap and exists to double as business centers.  </p>

			<h1>The Characters</h1>
			<p>Apex has made the potentially very unwise decision to start a content creation business out in New Port. He's invited some friends out to help but some trouble is afoot in the city's undergrounds. Crime is rampant and the highest of the wealthy are blatantly corrupt. Even Apex needs to make some shady deals with TezCo to keep Friend Team afloat. </p>
