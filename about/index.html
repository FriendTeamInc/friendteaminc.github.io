			<h1>What is Friend Team Inc.?</h1>
			<p class="tab"> Friend Team Inc. (or just Friend Team or FTI for short) is a collective of friends with a common passion: being silly idiots on the internet. Everyone is here to just make something fun and dumb, because we can and because the internet is our home. Check out what each of us does! </p>
			<br>

			<h1>Meet the Members!</h1>
			<h2>NotQuiteApex</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Apex, Logan, Bogan)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him, Rated T for Teens)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Meet Apex, the founder of FTI and "manager" of the group. He's a variety streamer, werewolf and bunny-hopping enthusiast, and computer extraordinaire. Most often he'll be playing whatever he feels like playing that day, be it grinding out Golden Berries in Celeste, top (or bottom) fragging in Open Fortress, longplays with friends in Minecraft or Terraria, rambling about code, or something absolutely crazy like cleaning his PC while he streams from it. Apex also maintains various bots, servers, and computer-related things for the group like VodBot. <br> In April of 2020 when lockdowns began, Apex took up streaming as a passtime between classes as the world scrambled to figure out how to handle the current state of affairs (some say they're still scrambling). On April 27th of that year, Apex was rewarded by Twitch.TV the title of Affiliate, becoming the first revenue-generating streamer of FTI. That day is celebrated as FTI's anniversary. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>JuiciBit</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Juice, Julien)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him, Rated T for Teens)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Juice is a wild one. He was the second official member of the group, but was also the one who had been streaming the longest, dating back to two years before Apex began. Whenever he's not Yu-Gi-Oh dueling cards or serving up tacos at a local chain establishment, he's an anime sentai crime fighting hero. But whenever he's not doing *that*, he's streaming himself in full gear picking off enemies in League of Legends or saving all his ink ribbons in Resident Evil. Rocking out with metal or just trying to survive till 6 AM in VR, Juice is always streaming with or for his friends both in and out of FTI. <br> In May of 2020, only a month after Apex, Juice became the second revenue-generating streamer of FTI. He often spends his payouts on any damages he may have caused in his line of work. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Alchana</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Al)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him, Rated T for Teens)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Alchana is the third member of the FTI crew. While not a highly regular streamer, you'll still see him experimenting and concocting silly ways to break whatever game he's playing. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Vivicaster</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Vivian, Vivi)</h4>
			<h5>(she/her, Rated M for Mature)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Vivian is a trans woman who will kick your ass and snipe your head. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Percy_Creates</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Percy)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him, Rated E for Everyone)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Percy is the best bunnyboy ever. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>HylianSwordsman</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Hylian)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him, Rated E for Everyone)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Hylian is hylian :) </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Toadzzz</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Sadie)</h4>
			<h5>(they/them, Rated T for Teen)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> catenby </p>
			<br>

			<h1>Meet the Bots!</h1>
			<h2>VodBot</h2>
			<p class="tab">Precious sweet boy love him very much!</p>
			<h2>VOXBot</h2>
			<p class="tab">Precious sweet boy love him very much too!</p>
			<h2>Cornley</h2>
			<p class="tab">he sucks.</p>
