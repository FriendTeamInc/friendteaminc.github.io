			<h1>What is Friend Team Inc.?</h1>
			<p class="tab"> Friend Team Inc. (or just Friend Team or FTI for short) is a collective of friends with a common passion: being silly idiots on the internet. Everyone is here to just make something fun and dumb, because we can and because the internet is our home. Check out what each of us does! </p>
			<br>

			<h1>Meet the Members!</h1>
			<h2>NotQuiteApex</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Apex, Logan, Bogan)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Meet Apex, the founder of FTI and "manager" of the group. He's a variety streamer, werewolf and bunny-hopping enthusiast, and computer extraordinaire. Most often he'll be playing whatever he feels like playing that day, be it grinding out Golden Berries in Celeste, top (or bottom) fragging in Open Fortress, longplays with friends in Minecraft or Terraria, rambling about code, playing Nintendo games with his bunny boyfriend, or something absolutely crazy like cleaning his PC while he streams from it. Apex also maintains various bots, servers, and computer-related things for the group like VodBot. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>JuiciBit</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Juice, Julien)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Juice is a wild one. He was the second official member of the group, but was also the one who had been streaming the longest, dating back to two years before Apex began. Whenever he's not Yu-Gi-Oh dueling cards or serving up tacos at a local chain establishment, he's an anime sentai crime fighting hero with a bit of a thing for a two-toned certain computer virus. But whenever he's not doing *that*, he's streaming himself in full gear picking off enemies in League of Legends or saving all his ink ribbons in Resident Evil. Rocking out with metal or just trying to survive till 6 AM in VR, Juice is always streaming with or for his friends both in and out of FTI. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Alchana</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Al)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Alchana was the third official member of the FTI crew. While not a highly regular streamer, you'll still see him experimenting and concocting silly ways to break whatever game he's playing. He has an affinity for the alchemical process and various magics of old, but the modern stuff will usually do just fine such as in CrossCode and Thaumcraft. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Vivicaster</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Vivian, Vivi)</h4>
			<h5>(she/her)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Vivian is a ghost, goblin, DnD DM, slasher movie villain, and proud trans woman all wrapped into one. She can quote many a horror media on a whim and still have time to quickscope you. Although The Thing is her favorite horror film, she's more than willing to try anything. From zombies to psych horror she can cover it all in her yearly Halloween festivities. Maybe one day you'll see some twisted vision of her own! She often streams herself playing DOOM WADs or messing around in the various SoulsBorneRingDieTwice games. She's rebellious, has an attitude, and her goth makeup of choice often involves vantablack. Groovy. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Percy_Creates</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Percy)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Percy is the resident artist, animator, and furry of FTI. Boyfriend of the founder, he's wiggled his way up to a high position and loves to use his cartoon hammer for funny bunny moments. Percy takes many forms, you'll see him show these off when he streams, be it streaming art, Pokemon, or playing games with the others like Minecraft or TF2. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>LyksaEXE</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Lyksa)</h4>
			<h5>(they/them)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Lyksa showed up one day on a PC that was in dire need of repairs, and out popped a floppy disk. Sparks flew and a flash of light later this weird virus VTuber became real. They've taken a liking to these old RPGMaker games, as well as a particular crime fighting sentai man. They also take commissions for others aspiring to VTube, creating overlays and models for a good price! Check them out and commission them! </p>

			<h2>HylianSwordsman</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Hylian)</h4>
			<h5>(he/him)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> Hylian isn't a streamer, but you will see him around plenty. This magic caster loves his swords, and is well equipped to help deal with any bad actors during the others' streams. Aside from that, he enjoys his fair share of Sci-Fi and the like and often helps everyone with special things behind the scenes, such as game coordination. He really wants you to play Outer Wilds. </p>
			<br>

			<h2>Toadzzz</h2>
			<h4>(aliases: Sadie)</h4>
			<h5>(they/them)</h5>
			<p class="tab"> We aren't entirely sure where Toadzzz came from. This stray cat enby showed up at our doorstep passed out and with lots of lasagna and just decided to stick around. They seem to really enjoy League of Legends, comdemning themselves to a life of solitude and perpetual toxicity (at least until they turn off the chat box). </p>
			<br>

			<h1>Meet the Bots!</h1>
			<h2>VodBot</h2>
			<p class="tab">Precious sweet boy love him very much!</p>
			<h2>VOXBot</h2>
			<p class="tab">Precious sweet boy love him very much too!</p>
			<h2>Cornley</h2>
			<p class="tab">he sucks.</p>
