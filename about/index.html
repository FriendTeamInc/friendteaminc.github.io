				<h1>What is Friend Team Inc.?</h1>
				<p class="tab"> Friend Team Inc. (or just Friend Team or F.T.I. for short) is a collective of friends with a common passion: being silly idiots on the internet. Everyone is here to just make something fun and dumb, because we can and because the internet is our home. </p>
				<br>

				<!-- MEET THE MEMBERS -->
				<h1>Meet the Members!</h1>
				<h2>NotQuiteApex</h2> <h4>(aliases: Apex, Bogan)</h4> <h5>(he/him)</h5>
				<p class="tab"> Meet Apex, the founder of F.T.I. and "manager" of the group. He's a variety streamer, werewolf and bunny-hopping enthusiast, and computer extraordinaire. Most often he'll be playing whatever he feels like playing that day, be it grinding out Golden Berries in Celeste, top (or bottom) fragging in Open Fortress, longplays with friends in Minecraft or Terraria, rambling about code, playing Nintendo games with his bunny boyfriend, or something absolutely crazy like cleaning his PC while he streams from it. Apex also maintains various bots, servers, and computer-related things for the group like VodBot. </p>
				<br>

				<h2>JuiciBit</h2> <h4>(aliases: Juice, Julien)</h4> <h5>(he/him)</h5>
				<p class="tab"> Juice is a wild one. He was the second official member of the group, but was also the one who had been streaming the longest, dating back to two years before Apex began. Whenever he's not Yu-Gi-Oh dueling cards or serving up tacos at a local chain establishment, he's an anime sentai crime fighting hero. But whenever he's not doing *that*, he's streaming himself in full gear picking off enemies in League of Legends or saving all his ink ribbons in Resident Evil. Rocking out with metal or just trying to survive till 6 AM in VR, Juice is always streaming with or for his friends both in and out of F.T.I. </p>
				<br>

				<h2>Prismatica</h2> <h4>(aliases: Iris)</h4> <h5>(she/her)</h5>
				<p class="tab"> The third official member of the FTI crew. While not a highly regular streamer, you'll still see her experimenting and concocting silly ways to break whatever game she's playing. She has an affinity for the alchemical process and various magics of old, but the modern stuff will usually do just fine such as in CrossCode and Hex Casting. </p>
				<br>

				<h2>Percy_Creates</h2> <h4>(aliases: Percy)</h4> <h5>(he/him)</h5>
				<p class="tab"> Percy is the resident artist, animator, and furry of FTI. Boyfriend of the founder, he's wiggled his way up to a high position and loves to use his cartoon hammer for funny bunny moments. Percy takes many forms, you'll see him show these off when he streams, be it streaming art, Pokemon, or playing games with the others like Minecraft or TF2. </p>
				<br>

				<h2>HylianSwordsman</h2> <h4>(aliases: Hylian)</h4> <h5>(he/him)</h5>
				<p class="tab"> Hylian isn't a streamer, but you will see him around plenty. This magic caster loves his swords, and is well equipped to help deal with any bad actors during the others' streams. Aside from that, he enjoys his fair share of Sci-Fi and the like and often helps everyone with special things behind the scenes, such as game coordination. He really wants you to play Outer Wilds. </p>
				<br>

				<h2>Toadzzz</h2> <h4>(aliases: Sadie, Toad)</h4> <h5>(they/them)</h5>
				<p class="tab"> We aren't entirely sure where Toadzzz came from. This stray cat enby showed up at our doorstep passed out and with lots of lasagna and just decided to stick around. They seem to really enjoy League of Legends, comdemning themselves to a life of solitude and perpetual toxicity (at least until they turn off the chat box). </p>
				<br>

				<!-- MEET THE BOTS -->
				<h1>Meet the Bots!</h1>
				<h2>VodBot</h2>
				<p class="tab">Precious sweet boy love him very much! VodBot was the brainchild of Apex, created after he got really annoyed with having to manage the stream archive alone but also not wanting to have anyone else involved in maintaining it. Written in a mess of Python and FFmpeg and HTTP requests, VodBot pulls, manages, and uploads the VODs, Clips, and more for F.T.I. along with many other streamers. His birthday is November 16th, 2020. You can find out more <a href="https://vodbot.friendteam.biz">here</a>.</p>
				<h2>VOXBot</h2>
				<p class="tab">Precious sweet boy love him very much too! VOX was the result of Apex deciding to self-host a music bot for the F.T.I. community Discord. He has since come into his own, becoming a part of the main cast and also serving multiple different servers. VOX runs on JMusicBot, you can find out more <a href="https://jmusicbot.com">here</a>.</p>
				<h2>Cornley</h2>
				<p class="tab">Cornley is our moderation management bot, based off some old code named after Portal 2 characters. He doesn't work very well, held together by some very unmaintained Python code. We do not love this.</p>

				<!-- IRL LORE -->
				<h1>The Story So Far</h1>
				<p class="tab"> Many of us know each other through various means, be it being friends at the same school, meeting up with others on Homestuck fansites, or through other friend groups. In April of 2020, after lockdowns began due to the pandemic, Apex took up streaming to fill the time between classes. On April 27th 2020, Apex became the first revenue generating streamer of FTI, rewarded the title of Affiliate by Twitch.TV. Only a month later, Juice became the second Affiliate of FTI despite streaming on and off for about two years before Apex began. The group began to grow at a reasonable rate and eventually the moniker and logo of Friend Team Inc. was born. More friends were indoctrinated and brought on to help Friend Team grow, not just to stream but to create fun projects and events for others to be apart of. </p>
				<p class="tab"> April 27th is treated as the group's formal anniversary, usually celebrated with a highlight video of many viewer-made clips from the past year, referencing many in-jokes and laughing at silly moments of gamer rage. Outside of this big event, other smaller events are sprinkled throughout the year to involve the community such as game nights, movie nights, or big event streams like driving the Desert Bus in Gmod, taking turns driving and messing around in the sandbox. Join the Discord so you don't miss out! </p>
