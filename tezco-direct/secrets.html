		<h1 id="title_text">TezCo. Direct Fun Facts!</h1>
		<h1 id="title_text">Did You Know...?</h1>
		
		<p>The direct was made in just 3 weeks! Tez proposed the idea in early June but was very unsure how receptive we would be to the idea.</p>
		<p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>This is the most complex video Apex has ever edited.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>"Apex & Tez: Hostile Takeover" was originally called "Apex + Tez: Corpo Crazy", and was planned to be a real game set to release on New Years 2023. Apex was too busy with school to make much progress past the concept art phase, like most of his projects.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Most of the artwork for "Apex & Tez: Hostile Takeover" was done by Matt, with concepts drawn by Apex and Cian. The sprites were all animated by Apex in one way or another.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>All the "Apex & Tez: Hostile Takeover" footage was made using a real game engine: LÃ–VE (aka love2d). It is not actually playable, but all the source code and assets can be found [here](todo: this).</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>There is about 10 hours of total footage that was recorded for this entire project.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>The Sooper Sekret Sauce ad is based off a running joke with Tez of the same name.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Any particle effects you see in the Minecraft footage were put together by Matt.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>It took over 30 takes for the Sooper Sekret Sauce ad to be completed. Most of the issues were with Matt flubbing the first few lines or Apex failing to be a good cameraman.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Apex was the cameraman for all the Minecraft segments except for the "Direct" where Tez is talking to the camera, which was recorded by Matt.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Apex used command blocks to get his camera consistent, centered, and ready for all the Minecraft shots. He would also unplug his mouse to ensure he did not bump it and mess it up.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Tez wrote the full script for the "Direct" segments, including the untranslated and translated parts, despite Matt being given the credit for "Translator".</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Tez spoke Norwegian during their "Direct" segments, as a joke on how Nintendo Direct presenters usually speak Japanese with English dubbed over. Matt provided the voice work for the English dub, because dubs are better than subs.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Percy was commissioned by Tez to make "burn-in" ads for the TezCo. Direct for Apex's stream, as a jab at Twitch's recent policy changes regarding advertising. This was one of the first gags completed for the Direct.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>One gag that was planned late but never made much progress beyond planning was a 3 minute segment of Percy rambling about a comic he's been working on. One Way Ticket will come soon, he promises.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>The tabletop roleplaying game segment was meant for Tezvania's TTRPG subgroup, "Chaotic Stupid", and references many of the past and present campaigns run by Tezvania members in systems like D&D 5e among others.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>May provided the voice over work for the TTRPG segment, and did a fantastic job! (Genuinely!)</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>May also accidentally played a work in progress version of the segment at full volume with family nearby, and the lack of context made things very awkward and very funny.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Zep was asked to create the TTRPG segment without much notice or information. Despite this, he put it together quickly and submitted it without any issue.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Matt and Tez spent an afternoon getting all the screenshots from previous Tezvania games, to narrow down which ones to eventually use in the video. Cian and Apex joined intermittently and helped reminisce.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>The Tezvania 6 world has, sadly, been lost to time.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Tezvania 9 was the first one to be streamed to Twitch, by Apex.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Matt made all the logos for the previous Tezvanias, and upgrades multiple old ones.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Tez and Matt used Litematica to write out TEZVANIA. The original was built by Tez.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>The TezMoney jumpscare was added two days before the video went live, and the sound made came from a botched youtube-to-mp3 download that Apex attempted. We don't know what the origin of that audio clip.</p>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p>Apex had his wisdom teeth removed the day the Direct premiered.</p>
